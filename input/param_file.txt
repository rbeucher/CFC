! Name of the RUN
NAMIBIA
! Name of the database

! Name of the output file

! Radius of the circle (in km)
! 25
! Name of the DEM file, note that the program is going to check if a highpass topography file exist
! file_name.flt, if not the file will be created and the calculation could take time
! My advice would be to filter the topography using a dedicated GIS software such as GRASS.
! In that case the file will have to use UTM35S projection and WGS84 datum 
Namibia_lowres.asc
!
! Name of the filtered topography
Namibia_lowres_filtered.asc
! Geothermal gradient (used to calculate the temperature offsets between samples. This can be a range
! In that case the program try to find the optimum value of the gradient for each inversion (each circle)
